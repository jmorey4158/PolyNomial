#TODOs

##Separate Helper Methods into files
Right now they are all in file. Not optimal but it works.

##Test creation of Equation class instance
Right now I do the calculation from the chucks. I really should do it from the master Equation object.

##Create Serialization code
I want to be able to serialize the Equation instances to DB for later re-hydration into Equation instances.

##Normalize equation strings
I want to add some robustness by allowing input equation string to be unordered. Kind tricky but sound like fun to me.
