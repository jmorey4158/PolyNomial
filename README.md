# PolyNomial
This project will have several methods that take a polynomial equation (string) and the values of the variables (decimal[]) and calculate the sum of the polynomial. 

#Purpose
This Project was created as my attempt to complete some famous coding problems. 
##StrictPolynomial()
This method requires that the input equation follow these restrictions:
1. Only two valuables x and y
2. Only integer exponents
3. Only integer coefficient
4. Only term operator is '+'
The equation can has N number terms.
